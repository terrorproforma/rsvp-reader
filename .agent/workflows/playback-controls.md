# All Controls Available During Playback

When building or modifying any reader/player interface:

1. **All adjustable settings must be accessible in the playback view**
   - Speed/WPM controls
   - Alignment/positioning options
   - Font size controls
   - Any other user-adjustable settings

2. **Controls should be modifiable without stopping playback**
   - Changes take effect immediately
   - No need to exit and re-enter the reader

3. **Controls should have consistent behavior**
   - Same control in different views should work identically
   - Changes sync bidirectionally between views

4. **Touch-friendly on mobile**
   - All interactive elements minimum 44px touch target
   - Adequate spacing between controls
